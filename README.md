### 📄 **README.txt — Low-Fidelity Wireframe for Food Delivery App**

**Project Title:**
🍴 *Food Delivery App – Low-Fidelity Wireframe Design*

---

**🧩 Objective:**
To design a **low-fidelity wireframe** showing the complete **user flow** of a food delivery application — from browsing restaurants to confirming an order.
This project focuses on **layout structure, user journey mapping, and screen transitions** before visual styling.

---

**🛠 Tools Used:**

* **Figma** (for wireframe design)
* Shapes, frames, text tools, and prototype linking were used to structure the screens.

---

**📱 Designed Screens:**

1. **App Logo & Welcome Page**

   * Displays a simple logo placeholder and navigation buttons for *Login* or *Sign Up*.

2. **Signup Page**

   * Basic input fields for user registration: Name, Email, Phone, Password.

3. **Login Page**

   * Fields for Username/Email and Password with “Forgot Password?” and “Sign up” options.

4. **Home Page**

   * Displays a *search bar* and *restaurant list* using rectangular placeholders.

5. **Menu Page**

   * Lists food items for the selected restaurant with item name, price, and add (+) buttons.

6. **Cart Page**

   * Shows selected items, quantity adjusters, and total price summary with a *“Proceed to Checkout”* button.

7. **Checkout Page**

   * Includes delivery options, payment summary, and a *“Place Order”* button.

8. **Order Confirmation Page**

   * Displays an order success message, order ID, and confirmation icon.

---

**🔄 User Flow Description:**
The flow begins at the **Welcome Page**, allowing users to either log in or sign up.
After logging in, users land on the **Home Page**, browse a **Restaurant Menu**, add items to their **Cart**, proceed to **Checkout**, and finally view the **Order Confirmation** screen.
Each step represents a seamless and minimal user journey from selection to purchase.

---

**🎨 Design Approach:**

* Followed *low-fidelity* design standards — using simple rectangles, lines, and text labels.
* Focused on *functionality and flow* rather than visuals or colors.
* Maintained *consistent spacing* and *clear hierarchy* for better readability.

**🧭 Key Learnings:**

* Gained experience in *wireframing and layout planning*.
* Understood *user navigation patterns* and how to structure an app’s flow.
* Learned to use *Figma’s prototyping* to connect screens logically.
